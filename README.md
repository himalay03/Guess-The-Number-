## About The App

A "Guess The Number" app in JavaScript is a simple game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within the range 1 and 20. The app prompts the user to enter a number and gives feedback if the guess is too high or too low.

The basic functionality of the app involves the following steps:

1. Generate a random number between 1 and 20.
2. Prompt the user to enter a guess.
3. Compare the user's guess with the random number.
4. If the guess is correct, congratulate the user and end the game.
5. If the guess is incorrect, give feedback to the user (e.g. "Too high" or "Too low"), and prompt them to guess again.
6. Repeat steps until the user guesses the correct number else, the score keeps getting reduced by 1 point on every wrong guess.
7. If the score becomes 0, the user looses the game.
